# MobX decorators and other

If you want to use decorators with query\mutation instances you need to configure your bundle.  
All next documentation contains code with accessor decorators which works using only with Babel. You can replace them with [`makeObservable`](https://mobx.js.org/observable-state.html#makeobservable), [`extendObservable`](https://mobx.js.org/api.html#extendobservable) MobX functions
